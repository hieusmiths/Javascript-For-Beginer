		// To Overcome thing on we using let. let b = 5; -> fasle let don't allow declare more one 1 times.
		// Const stand for constant you will using it when you ensure value of variable never change.

		// Thing on : điều trên.
		// Obligatory : Bắt buộc - o bờ lai gây to ry.
		// Const also (ó sầu) has property like a let
		// Another declare let and var while you daclare avarible with Const you must obligatory

		// when you has function name is Run() and using variable before daclare this function will resturn underfined if type of variable is var
		// for function Run() you using it before daclare and type of it is let function can't run.
		// about const, it has effect like a most when you daclare variable with let.
		// Using var your code will inncurred Hoisting. To overcome it recommed using declare variable by let and const.


		// Var has function scope -> bài 48 js basic

		// Let and Const don't has function scope only has Block Scope.
		// Recap -> tom tắt
		// var is function scope.
		// let and const are block scope.
		// Function scope is within the function.
		// Block scope is within curly brackets. (dấu ngoặc nhọn)
		// Scope is everything within brackets.

		// To Overcome thing on , you must using variable has property has Block Scope is let and const.
		if(true){
			let y = 10;
		}
		// or
		{
			const v = 30;
		}
		console.log(v); // -> error.
		console.log(y); // -> error.
		// while coding developer will limit scope of variables to improve and increase performance of programing.
